# Gasser_Monitor_v1

This project aims to create a bolt on device that has huge potential to monitor RC equipment for a full range of problems
or just provide a standard data set that can be reviewed and understood across all models.

Over the last 18 months many proof of concept bench tests have been completed and it is now time to migrate code into a
project so some more real life testing and data comparisons can take place.
